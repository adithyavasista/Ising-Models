# Ising-Models
This repository provides a brief overview of different Ising models, including:             1. Classical Ising model without transverse field         2. Converting the XY transverse field Ising model to classical using the Trotter factor 3. Entanglement in the transverse field Ising model during Quantum Phase Transition
